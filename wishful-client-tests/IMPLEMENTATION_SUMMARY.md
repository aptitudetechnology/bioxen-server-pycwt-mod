## 🎯 Key Design Principles

### 1. Biologically Honest
- **Only tests circadian entrainment for organisms WITH clock genes**
  - ✅ Yeast (with FRQ/WC homologs)
  - ✅ Cyanobacteria (KaiABC)
  - ✅ Neurospora (FRQ/WC-1/WC-2)
  - ❌ E. coli (no circadian genes)
  - ❌ Syn3A (no circadian genes)

- **Light is environmental INPUT, not imposed clock**
  - Tests entrainment (synchronization of EMERGENT oscillator)
  - Not claiming sensors "create" rhythms

- **Temperature compensation is testable**
  - Q10 ≈ 1 for circadian period (temperature compensated)
  - Q10 ≈ 2-3 for metabolic rates (temperature dependent)
  - This distinction validates model accuracy

### 2. Scientifically Grounded
Based on real circadian biology experiments:
- **Phase Response Curves (PRC)** - Classic circadian protocol
- **Free-running period (tau)** - DD/LL measurements
- **Temperature compensation (Q10)** - Hallmark of circadian clocks
- **Entrainment dynamics** - Time to synchronize
- **Heat shock response** - HSP upregulation (dnaK, groEL)

### 3. API-First Design
- Defines clear REST API contracts
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, DELETE
- JSON request/response formats
- Async operations (202 Accepted for long-running tasks)
- Error handling patterns

### 4. TDD Approach
- Write tests BEFORE implementing APIs
- Tests define what "correct" looks like
- Guides implementation decisions
- Ensures testability from the start

## 🔬 Addresses Claude's Critique

**Original Problem:** Earlier project claimed VMs "self-regulate using circadian clocks like computer clock signals"

**Claude's Critique:**
> "Computer clocks are EXTERNAL oscillators (INPUT). Circadian clocks are EMERGENT from biochemical feedback loops (OUTPUT). You can't 'base' a VM on circadian rhythms."

**Our Solution:**
✅ Tests only use circadian analysis for organisms that HAVE clock genes  
✅ Light/temperature are environmental INPUTS that affect EMERGENT oscillators  
✅ Not claiming sensors create rhythms - they provide zeitgebers  
✅ Focused on model validation, not biological mimicry  
✅ E. coli and Syn3A are tested WITHOUT circadian assumptions

## 📊 Test Coverage Matrix

| Organism | Has Clock Genes? | Circadian Tests? | Temperature Tests? | Sensor Tests? |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| E. coli | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Heat shock | ✅ All sensors |
| Yeast | ✅ Yes (FRQ/WC) | ✅ Entrainment, PRC, tau | ✅ Q10, cycles | ✅ All sensors |
| Syn3A | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Growth rate | ✅ All sensors |
| Cyanobacteria | ✅ Yes (KaiABC) | ✅ Entrainment, Q10 | ✅ Compensation | ✅ All sensors |

## 🎓 Educational Value

These tests serve multiple purposes even before implementation:

1. **API Specification** - Clear contracts for future development
2. **Biological Documentation** - What real experiments look like
3. **Training Material** - Learn circadian biology through code
4. **TDD Blueprint** - Guides implementation when we build APIs
5. **Scientific Validation** - Ensures biological plausibility

## 🚀 Implementation Timeline

### Phase 0 (Complete): ✅ Specification
- Define API contracts through tests
- Document biological experiments
- Create fixtures and helper functions

### Phase 1-4 (Current): 🔄 Local Validation
- Build VM simulation engine
- Implement four-lens analysis
- Add validation framework (not self-regulation)
- Performance profiling

### Phase 4: ⏳ Performance Assessment
- Benchmark analysis overhead
- Memory profiling
- Decide: local sufficient or need remote?

### Phase 5-6: ⏳ REST API (Conditional)
- **IF** Phase 4 shows bottlenecks
- Build FastAPI server
- Implement endpoints defined in these tests
- Run test suite using TDD

### Phase 6+: ⏳ Hardware Integration
- Raspberry Pi with I2C sensors
- BME280 (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- LTR-559 (light, proximity)
- Real-time environmental data streaming

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Work

### Aligns With Recent Reframing
From `REFRAMING_COMPLETE.md`:
- ✅ Model validation (not self-regulation)
- ✅ Parameter tuning based on validation
- ✅ Scientifically honest about what we're doing
- ✅ Frequency analysis for validation, not biological mimicry

### Complements Existing Tests
- `client-tests/` - PyCWT-mod hardware acceleration (wavelet server)
- `wishful-client-tests/` - BioXen biological validation (this suite)
- Both follow same TDD pattern
- Both define APIs before implementation

### Fits Roadmap
From `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`:
- Phase 3: Automated model validation
- Phase 5-6: Remote computation (conditional)
- These tests define Phase 6+ API surface
