Aspirational test suite defining ideal API contracts for:
- Environmental sensor integration (BME280, LTR-559)
- Circadian entrainment validation
- Model validation and parameter tuning
- VM lifecycle and continuous simulation

These tests define what we WOULD test if we had the server APIs implemented.
