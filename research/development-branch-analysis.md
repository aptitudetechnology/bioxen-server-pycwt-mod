# Development Branch Analysis

## Overview
The upstream `development` branch (https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt/tree/development) contains significant refactoring but **no major new features** addressing the performance concerns.

## Major Changes in Development Branch

### 1. **Project Structure Refactoring** (Breaking Change)
- Moved code from `pycwt/` → `src/pycwt/`
- Modern Python packaging structure
- Added `pyproject.toml` (PEP 518 compliance)
- Removed old `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in`, `requirements.txt`

### 2. **Code Quality Improvements**
- Applied code formatter (black/autopep8)
- Changed `numpy as np` → `numpy` throughout
- Minor docstring fixes and typos
- Updated imports to use full module paths

### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- Revamped documentation structure
- Better getting started guide
- Updated MkDocs configuration
- Added more examples

### 4. **CI/CD Updates**
- Updated Travis CI configuration
- Better testing infrastructure

## What's NOT in Development Branch

### Missing Performance Features:
- ❌ No GPU acceleration
- ❌ No parallelization of Monte Carlo
- ❌ No batch processing API
- ❌ No pre-computed coefficient injection
- ❌ No surrogate generation utilities
- ❌ No synchrosqueezing support

### Algorithm Changes:
- ❌ No changes to FFT-based CWT algorithm
- ❌ No changes to WCT/XWT implementation  
- ❌ No changes to Monte Carlo significance testing
- ❌ Still 300 sequential iterations

## Key Findings

**The development branch is primarily a maintenance/refactoring release, NOT a performance optimization release.**

### Code Comparison:
```python
# Main branch (0.3.0a22):
pycwt/wavelet.py    - 664 lines (FFT-based)
pycwt/mothers.py    - 234 lines (4 wavelets)
pycwt/helpers.py    - 237 lines (basic utilities)

# Development branch:
src/pycwt/wavelet.py - ~664 lines (same algorithm, reformatted)
src/pycwt/mothers.py - ~234 lines (same wavelets)
src/pycwt/helpers.py - ~240 lines (minor updates)
```

## Conflicts with Your Work

Your repository has:
- `FFT-based-performance-bottleneck-massive-datasets-prompt.*.md` (3 files)
- `Python Libraries for Multi-Signal Wavelet Coherence in Computational Biology.md`
- `pwt-report.md` (your analysis)
- Original `pycwt/` structure

Development branch wants to:
- Delete your research prompts and report
- Move code to `src/pycwt/`
- Update documentation structure

## Recommendation

**DO NOT merge the development branch directly.**

Instead:

### Option 1: Cherry-pick specific improvements
```bash
# Get specific improvements without restructuring
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # for specific bug fixes
```

### Option 2: Create a hybrid approach
1. Keep your current structure (`pycwt/` folder)
2. Apply code formatting from development
3. Cherry-pick bug fixes only
4. Maintain your research documents

### Option 3: Fork development and add your work
1. Create a new branch from upstream/development
2. Re-add your research documents
3. Adapt to the new `src/` structure
4. Continue from there

### Option 4: Stay on main branch
- Your main branch is functionally complete
- Development branch adds no performance improvements
- Focus on implementing the optimizations from your research
- Sync later when development has meaningful features

## Version Information

- **Your main branch**: pycwt 0.3.0a22 (functional, stable)
- **Upstream development**: ~0.4.0-beta (refactored, no new features)
- **Upstream main**: Likely older than your fork

## Conclusion

**The development branch does NOT address any of the performance bottlenecks identified in your research.**

All the issues remain:
- FFT-based CWT (same algorithm)
- Sequential Monte Carlo (still 300 iterations)
- No parallelization
- No GPU support
- No batch processing

**Your research and optimization plans are still 100% valid and necessary.**

The development branch is just a code cleanup/modernization, not a performance enhancement.
