# FFT Performance Bottlenecks in Biological Wavelet Analysis - MVP Research

**Research Question:** Does pycwt's FFT-based wavelet coherence implementation create unacceptable performance bottlenecks for typical biological signal analysis compared to alternative architectures?

---

## 🎯 Core Investigation

The comparative analysis document identified that pycwt uses FFT-based computation which "may introduce performance bottlenecks when compared to libraries leveraging lower-level C/Cython implementations or GPU acceleration" for massive biological datasets. Before committing to pycwt as BioXen's wavelet coherence engine, we must empirically validate whether these theoretical concerns translate to practical limitations.

---

## 📊 Essential Research Questions

### **Question 1: pycwt Performance Characterization**

Establish empirical performance baselines for pycwt across biologically relevant dataset scales.

**Investigation Areas:**
- How does pycwt's wavelet transform computation time scale with signal length? (Test range: 100 timepoints to 10 million timepoints)
- At what dataset size does memory consumption become prohibitive on standard hardware?
- What is the computational overhead of wavelet coherence (WCT) compared to individual continuous wavelet transforms (CWT)?
- How does significance testing via Monte Carlo methods scale with iteration count?

**Biological Context:**
- Circadian gene expression: ~100-200 timepoints (hourly sampling over days)
- Single-cell imaging: ~1,000-10,000 timepoints (minutes at 5-minute intervals)
- Physiological signals (ECG, blood pressure): ~100,000-1,000,000 timepoints (hours at 100 Hz)
- Neural recordings: ~10,000,000+ timepoints (minutes at 30 kHz)

**What to Determine:**
- Is there a super-linear performance degradation for large datasets?
- Does pycwt exhibit O(N log N) FFT scaling or worse in practice?
- What are the practical upper limits for interactive analysis (<10 seconds) vs. batch processing (<10 minutes)?

---

### **Question 2: PyWavelets Performance Comparison**

Quantify the performance advantage of PyWavelets' C/Cython implementation over pycwt's FFT-based approach.

**Investigation Areas:**
- What is the speedup factor for continuous wavelet transform computation across different signal lengths?
- Are the CWT outputs numerically equivalent between libraries? (Critical for scientific validity)
- Does the speedup justify architectural complexity of integrating multiple libraries?

**Key Validation:**
The comparative analysis states PyWavelets "often grants a significant speed advantage over purely Python or FFT-based alternatives." We must verify:
- Actual speedup magnitude (2×? 5×? 10×?)
- Whether speedup is consistent across scales or only evident at certain dataset sizes
- If numerical differences exist, are they within acceptable tolerance for biological interpretation?

---

### **Question 3: Feasibility of Hybrid Architecture**

Evaluate whether PyWavelets CWT coefficients can be fed into pycwt's wavelet coherence calculations.

**Investigation Areas:**
- Does pycwt expose functions that accept pre-computed CWT coefficients, or must CWT and WCT be computed together?
- If pycwt's WCT implementation is tightly coupled to its CWT computation, what mathematical steps would be required to create a custom WCT function?
- What is pycwt's smoothing algorithm (critical for WCT calculation), and can it be replicated independently?

**Architectural Question:**
The comparative analysis suggests: "core CWT complex coefficients for signals X and Y could be rapidly generated using pywt.cwt, and these highly optimized coefficients could then be seamlessly integrated into pycwt's proven and statistically robust WCT calculation." Is "seamless integration" actually feasible, or does this require substantial custom implementation?

---

### **Question 4: Real-World Biological Validation**

Test performance on actual biological datasets, not just synthetic signals.

**Investigation Areas:**
- CircaDB gene expression time series: Can pycwt compute pairwise wavelet coherence for 5-10 genes in reasonable time?
- What is the end-to-end analysis time for a typical research workflow (load data → preprocess → compute all pairwise WCT → significance testing)?
- Do performance bottlenecks manifest in ways not captured by synthetic benchmarks?

**Practical Context:**
Researchers may want to compute wavelet coherence across dozens of signal pairs. If each pair takes 30 seconds, a 10×10 comparison matrix (45 unique pairs) would require 22.5 minutes. Is this acceptable for interactive exploration, or does it require overnight batch processing?

---

### **Question 5: Production Deployment Decision**

Based on empirical findings, determine whether optimization is necessary or if pycwt's performance is acceptable as-is.

**Decision Framework:**

**Scenario A: pycwt is Sufficient**
- Performance is acceptable for 90%+ of target biological datasets
- Bottlenecks only appear in extreme edge cases (multi-hour neural recordings)
- Recommendation: Ship with pycwt, document performance limits

**Scenario B: Optimization Required**
- pycwt creates friction for common use cases (e.g., >30 seconds for typical datasets)
- PyWavelets demonstrates substantial speedup (>2×) with numerical equivalence
- Recommendation: Implement hybrid architecture or provide backend selection

**Critical Thresholds:**
- What constitutes "acceptable" performance? (Interactive: <10s, Batch: <5 min?)
- At what dataset size does the performance/complexity trade-off favor optimization?
- Can we define a simple heuristic: "Use pycwt for N<X, use hybrid for N>X"?

---

### **Numerical Validation Approach**

- Calculate relative error metrics
- Visualize scalograms side-by-side
- Test on known biological patterns (e.g., circadian rhythms with expected ~24-hour periodicity)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Correlation >0.99 suggests strong equivalence
- Mean relative error <1% suggests practical equivalence
- Visual scalogram inspection reveals no systematic distortions
