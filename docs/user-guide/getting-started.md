Getting started
===============

PyCWT is a Python module for continuous wavelet spectral analysis. It includes
a collection of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via
FFT algorithm. In addition, the module also includes cross-wavelet transforms,
wavelet coherence tests and sample scripts. The code is based on Torrence and
Compo (1998)\ [#f1]_. Additional useful references are listed at the end of
this page.

This module requires ``NumPy`` and ``SciPy``. In addition, you also need
``matplotlib`` to run the samples.

The sample scripts (``sample.py``, ``sample_xwt.py``) illustrate the use of
the wavelet and inverse wavelet transforms, cross-wavelet transform and
wavelet transform coherence. Results are plotted in figures similar to the
sample images.
