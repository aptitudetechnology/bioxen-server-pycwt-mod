# Branch Migration Summary

## What We Did

Successfully created a new branch `development-with-research` that combines:
1. ✅ Upstream's modernized code structure (from `upstream/development`)
2. ✅ Your valuable research documents and analysis

## Branch Structure

### New Branch: `development-with-research`

```

└── README.md              # Updated main README
```

## Key Benefits of This Approach

### From Upstream Development Branch:
- ✅ Modern `src/` layout (PEP 518 compliant)
- ✅ `pyproject.toml` for better packaging
- ✅ Code formatting improvements
- ✅ Updated documentation structure
- ✅ Better CI/CD configuration

### Your Research Preserved:
- ✅ All research documents organized in `research/` directory
- ✅ Code analysis report (pwt-report.md)
- ✅ Performance bottleneck analysis (3 variants)
- ✅ Comparative library analysis
- ✅ Branch analysis and merge strategy

## Git History

```bash
# Current branch structure:
main                         # Your original fork (pycwt/ structure)
└── development-with-research  # NEW: upstream/development + your research
    ├── (upstream commits)
    └── feat: Add BioXen wavelet coherence performance research
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Push the New Branch (Recommended)

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin development-with-research

# Or set as upstream and push
git push -u origin development-with-research
```

### 2. Decide on Main Branch Strategy

**Option A: Keep both branches**
- `main` - Original structure, stable
- `development-with-research` - Modernized structure, active development

**Option B: Make development-with-research the new main**
```bash
# After thorough testing
git checkout development-with-research
git branch -D main
git checkout -b main
git push origin main --force
```

**Option C: Merge into main later**
```bash
# After validating everything works
git checkout main
git merge development-with-research
```

### 3. Update Import Paths (if needed)

The new structure uses `src/pycwt/` instead of `pycwt/`. When developing:

```python
# Old imports (main branch):
from pycwt import cwt, wct
from pycwt.mothers import Morlet

# New imports (development-with-research):
from pycwt import cwt, wct  # Still works!
from pycwt.mothers import Morlet  # Still works!

# The src/ layout is transparent to users
```

### 4. Continue Your Research

Your research documents are now in the `research/` directory:

```bash
cd research/
ls -l
# All your analysis is here!
```

## Important Notes

### What Changed in Code Structure

1. **Package location**: `pycwt/` → `src/pycwt/`
   - This is a modern Python best practice
   - Prevents accidental imports from source directory
   - Encourages proper package installation

2. **Import style**: `import numpy as np` → `import numpy`
   - Upstream's style choice
   - Functionally equivalent

3. **Configuration**: Multiple files → `pyproject.toml`
   - Modern packaging standard (PEP 518)
   - Simpler build configuration

### What Didn't Change

1. **Algorithm**: Still FFT-based CWT
2. **Performance**: Same bottlenecks identified in your research
3. **API**: Same function signatures and behavior
4. **Features**: No new features (confirmed in your analysis)

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check branch
git branch -v

# Check files
ls -la research/
ls -la src/pycwt/

# Test import (if installed in development mode)
python -c "import pycwt; print(pycwt.__version__)"
```

## Backup Information

Your original files are backed up at:
```
~/pycwt-research-backup/
```

## Summary

✅ **Success!** You now have a clean branch that combines:
- Upstream's modern code structure
- Your comprehensive research analysis
- Clear organization for future development

The research documents are preserved and organized, ready for:
- MVP benchmarking implementation
- Performance optimization work
- Collaboration with team members
